                    I completed all of the reading materials, participated in the 
                    team activity, and updated my portfolio to include this weeks 
                    notes, questions, and exercises. I removed the 'Responses' 
                    section as per last week's report and removed the 'Team Activity' 
                    section as our team has a separate repository. I was not able 
                    to transition this week's lists to JavaScript as intended. This 
                    week I will transition this upcoming week's lists to JavaScript. 
                    Also, I need to review the reading materials from the past two 
                    weeks. Although last week the coding was straight forward, this 
                    week I am struggling to adapt my Java-set mind to JavaScript syntax.
