                    Since last week, I have began updating the local storage for
                    the ToDo application as per instructor feedback. I have read 
                    through all the materials for the week, and I have completed
                    the team activity core requirements. This week, I will finish
                    updating the ToDo application to include filtering, debug the
                    Quiz Ninja application, and prepare for the team activity that 
                    I will be leading. The learning approach for this class has been 
                    difficult to adjust to. However, I feel that I have finally 
                    caught onto the expectations for the course. The greatest 
                    obstacle will be catching up by the end of this week.
