        <h3>Notes:</h3>
        <p>
            This week, I was more focused on setting up the website on Github than the reading
            materials. There wasn't anything in particular that I felt that I needed to take
            notes on.
        </p>
        <h3>Questions:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Does this course require a fundamental understanding of JavaScript or will basic
                JavaScript be taught in this course?
            </li>
            <li>
                Would you create a video that explains the learning style of this course better?
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Exercises:</h3>
        <ul>

                What did I do since the last meeting?<br><br>
                I have read everything for this week and have setup Github and Visual Studio to 
                update my portfolio. Finally, I have created and updated my portfolio.<br><br>

            <li>
                What am I going to do next?<br><br>
                I am going to prepare finish all the assignments for this week and begin 
                preparations for next weeks coursework.<br><br>
            </li>
            <li>
                What are my blockers?<br><br>
                As of right now, there is not anything that is preventing me from completing 
                the courseword. That said, the JavaScript Youtube video was beyond my current 
                JavaScript skills which has me concerned about this course.
