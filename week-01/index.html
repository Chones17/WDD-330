        <h3>Notes:</h3>
        <p>
            This week, I was more focused on setting up the website on Github than the reading
            materials. There wasn't anything in particular that I felt that I needed to take
            notes on.

            <li>
                Does this course require a fundamental understanding of JavaScript or will basic
                JavaScript be taught in this course?
