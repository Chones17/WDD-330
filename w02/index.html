                <p>
                    Since last week, I have read through chapter 2-4 in JavaScript: 
                    Novice to Ninja. I contributed to and finished the Team Activity 
                    as a member of Group 5. I, also, updated My Portfolio to include week 
                    2 notes, questions, and exercises. This upcoming week, I will be 
                    removing the Reports section in My Portfolio as it is redundant, 
                    I will transition week three lists to JavaScript as opposed to coding 
                    them individually in html, and completing the readings and homework 
                    associated with the week. The greatest blocker so far this week has 
                    been time. The code has not been overwhelming thus far.
