                    I was able to complete all of the required modules for this week including the 
                    Team Activity. I have updated My Portfolio to reflect some of the notes from 
                    the readings and questions that I had. I still have not discovered what is wrong 
                    with the Ninja exercise. This week I will be cleaning up the Ninja exercise to 
                    hopefully make it clear where the issue is taking place, as well as creating tests 
                    beyond the current code. I am still in the process of updating My Portfolio to be 
                    more user friendly. My misunderstanding of things from the first week have created 
                    a need to go back and correct missteps.
