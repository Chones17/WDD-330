                <p>
                    I have completed all of the reading materials for this week and I 
                    participated in the Team Activity. I have been working on the 
                    mid-semester updates and will have those completed this week. Given 
                    enough time, I will troubleshoot the inoperable Quiz Ninja site and 
                    work on the final project. The obstacles for this week have been 
                    balancing the coursework and my personal responsibilities. I have 
                    not figured out how to achieve the proper balance, but am implementing 
                    a new strategy this week to see how the workload is balanced.
