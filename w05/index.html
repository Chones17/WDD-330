                    I was able to complete all of the required modules for this 
                    week including the Team Activity. I have updated My Portfolio 
                    to reflect some of the notes from the readings and questions that 
                    I had. I still have not discovered what is wrong with the Ninja 
                    exercise. This week I will be cleaning up the Ninja exercise to 
                    hopefully make it clear where the issue is taking place, as well 
                    as creating tests beyond the current code. I am still in the process 
                    of updating My Portfolio to be more user friendly. My misunderstanding 
                    of things from the first week have created a need to go back and 
                    correct missteps.
