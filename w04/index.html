                    Since last week, I have spent a significant amount of time updating 
                    My Portfolio to better represent the course materials and what I 
                    have learned. I have added a CSS directory and updated many of the 
                    visual characteristics of My Portfolio. I have also updated the 
                    JavaScript to better represent the tools learned in this course. 
                    Unfortunately, I misunderstood some of the work early on which has 
                    affected my current progress (specifically with Quiz Ninja). I will 
                    be working the next two weeks to get My Portfolio where it needs 
                    to be as well as fix a significant portion of the code.
