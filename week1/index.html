        <h1>Week One</h1>
        <h3>Notes:</h3>
        <p>
            This week I was more focused on setting up the website on Github than the reading
            materials. There wasn't anything in particular that I felt that I needed to take
            notes on.
        </p>
        <h3>Questions:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Does this course require a fundamental understanding of JavaScript or will basic
                JavaScript be taught in this course?
            </li>
        </ul>
